## Updating meeting times / places

Edit `_config.yml` and update the settings "ritlug-time", "ritlug-place", and
"ritlug-day". These are used (and should be used) everywhere on the website
the meeting time and place are referenced so that they can be updated in
one place.


## Javascript and CSS patches

There's a couple of patches to the Javascript and CSS. They are:

### Header Height

The default header in Material Design Lite is too large on desktop so we've
shrank it. If you want to change the header height, do the following:

1. Open `css/styles.css`
2. Search for `.mdl-demo .mdl-layout__header-row {`.
3. Find and change the height. Default is 64px. We're currently using 25px.


## Developing and testing
