Hey RITluggers!
I am sending out the email for this week on behalf of Justin. Below is his pitch for the talk.

Creepers and skeletons got you down this October? Or maybe you're anticipating the endless Minecraft costumes by the kids of the world on Halloween? What about how the official RIT Minecraft server is managed? Learn more about SpigotMC, the open source Minecraft server software that lets you build your own Minecraft server and extend it beyond what the developers ever imagined. We'll create a server and how to customize it your liking.



### tl;dr details

* **Day**: Friday, Oct. 13, 2017
* **Time**: 4:00pm - 6:00pm
    * Talk begins at 4:30pm
* **Where**: GOL-2650 (large DB lab, 2nd floor of GCCIS)

Hope to see you there! 


May the light of FOSS shine upon you
