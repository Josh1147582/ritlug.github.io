Hello RITlug,
I have taken a look at the results of the whenisgood poll and based on the responses the TigerOS project meetings will be held at 11AM on Fridays. They will be in the conference room in the link between the fish bowl and GCCIS (University Services Center 1100) starting on Friday October 6th. Hope to see you there!
#### Come say hello to us!

RITlug is in a variety of places, but the best way to keep in touch with the community is via the Telegram group and/or IRC channel. The bridge between the two keeps the chats synchronized. Conversations are active daily and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to co-op advice to random topics. You can also find us on Facebook as well (but not much is happening there!).
